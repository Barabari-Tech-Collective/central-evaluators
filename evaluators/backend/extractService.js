// Bug: reported with a screenshot from the live UI — a repoUrl like
// "https://github.com/user/repo/tree/main/HTTP%20server/Assignment" always
// failed with a generic "couldn't download the repository" error. That's
// GitHub's own web-UI URL for *browsing a folder in a browser* — the format
// `git clone` understands is "https://github.com/user/repo.git" (confirmed:
// `git ls-remote` on the tree URL fails with "repository not found", the
// same URL with the /tree/... suffix stripped clones fine). This is a very
// common real submission shape: a student's assignment lives in a subfolder
// of a larger class repo, and copying the URL from GitHub's folder view
// (rather than constructing the repo's clone URL by hand) is the natural
// thing to do. Fix: detect this specific GitHub shape, clone the actual
// repo at the referenced branch, and root the evaluation at the referenced
// subfolder instead of the repo root — everything downstream (sandbox
// upload, detectLanguage, the test runners) is unaffected, since they only
// ever see whatever path extractSubmission returns.
